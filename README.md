# Face_recognition_based_attendance_system
A Python GUI-integrated attendance system using face recognition to take attendance:

In this Python project, I have made an attendance system that takes attendance by using face recognition techniques. I have also integrated it with a GUI (Graphical user interface), so it can be easily used by anyone. The GUI for this project is also made in Python using Tkinter.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1) tkinter for whole GUI
2) OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
3) CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime, etc. for other purposes.

FEATURES:
1) Easy to use with interactive GUI support.
2) Password protection for new person registration.
3) Creates or updates a CSV file for the details of students on registration.
4) Creates a new CSV file every day for attendance and marks attendance with the proper date and time.
5) Displays live attendance updates for the day on the main screen in tabular format with ID, name, date, and time.

NOTE: PLEASE DON'T DELETE OR RENAME THE EMPTY FOLDERS AND CSVs IN THE PROJECT AS THEY ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE 'main.py' FILE.
